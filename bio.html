    <h1>My Bio</h1>
    <h2> Who am I? </h2>

Hi, I’m Nick. I’m a 22-year-old student with an interest in IT, creative writing, and board games. I’m from Canberra, where I lived for most of my childhood. I moved to Melbourne in 2021 and was hit in the face with a lockdown the day after arriving. I’m now triple-vaxxed, and very pleased to be in an opened-up Melbourne. I learned Japanese in school but am slowly forgetting it. My favourite pastime is, at the moment, Dungeons & Dragons. I am the DM (Dungeon Master), and I love coming up with new scenarios for my group to encounter. I also love travel, and hope to do that more when I can. Most of all, I'm looking forward to learning a lot of IT skills at RMIT!

<h2> How did I get interested in IT? </h2>
Since childhood, I’ve always been interested in computers. I had a strong desire to learn what each of the programs on my computer were and how I could use them. In primary school, I was known as the kid that teachers could call on to fix problems with their computers. It wasn’t until later that I started learning what IT was as a field. I remember visiting my next-door neighbour’s house, who showed me a program that he was using to automatically compress files. He asked me to guess what it was doing, and I had no idea. It was then that I realised I had a lot more to learn. 
<br><br>
When I decided that I wanted to pursue a career in IT, I had already moved to Melbourne. So RMIT was the natural choice. I also got a recommendation from one of my friends who was studying at RMIT. He spoke glowingly of the university’s facilities and central location. Following his recommendation, I visited for an open day and found that I liked it too. At RMIT, I hope to progress from a vague interest in IT to a competent understanding. I hope to find a subset of this broad field that fits me best. Knowing that, I expect to hone my skills and develop real competency which will lead me into employment. I hope to meet people who share similar interests to me, and work with them in a fun and friendly way. 

<h2>What do Personality Tests Think of Me?</h2>
My MBTI result is ISTP-T. Specifically, I am 73% Extroverted, 51% Observant, 62% Thinking, 67% Prospecting, and 65% Turbulent. I have done the MBTI in the past and returned the INTP-T result. 
<br><br>
My Learning Style is Auditory (45%), compared to Visual (35%) and Tactile (20%). 
<br><br>
In the Big Five test, I scored 73% Open, 33% Conscientious, 46% Extraverted, 60% Agreeable, and 77% Neurotic. 
<br><br>
Based on these results, I have learned that I am Introverted. To me, this means that I like quiet work. Once I know what I am to do, I like being left alone and to do my own work. My 77% Neurotic score surprised me. I suppose this means I would need more reassurance than some other people.  I do like showing off my work, and I think that getting people’s responses is important to me. I’ve also learned that I am an Auditory learner. I like listening to music, and always try to sit near to the front of lectures. Overall, I don’t personally put too much stock in the results of these results.
<br><br>
However, I understand that these sorts of tests are industry practice for hiring and am certainly prepared to take them when required. My high turbulence score in the MBTI suggests to me that I would function well in a team with strong leadership, but also room to experiment. I would likely want some group work, but not too much, as I like to do my own thing. That said, I would also appreciate periodical check-ins to recalibrate everyone’s direction.
