    <h1>My idea</h1>
My project idea is for a new type of name generator, which will be able to generate realistic and fantastical names for people and characters. It will be in the form of a webapp, which will be accessed via website. Users will create accounts and select base name generation libraries. They will create their own rules for the name generation and output long lists of names which could then be further refined and modified or downloaded and shared. Users will also be able to create their own name generation libraries. The names that they receive can then be used for naming children or fictional characters
<br> <br>

Across the world, people struggle back and forth when it comes to naming children or characters. While I haven’t had kids, the baby names website nameberry.com is incredibly popular – it gets 3.5 million hits monthly. As a creative writer, and an avid role-playing gamer, I am always finding the need to come up with many unique and interesting names. No currently existing service provides an easy-to-use and customisable way of generating names en masse. Markov Chains are a mathematical process, which, when combined with random generators, can generate large swaths of data with simple rules. If they were neatly packaged into a simple and easily accessible webapp, it would be a boon to countless creatives and expectant parents worldwide. 
<br> <br>

Users would have an account on the webapp and would be able to access two different versions of it. There would be a free version, which would offer a limited ‘free sample’ experience. There would also be a subscription service, which would allow full access. As mobile phones are a popular way to browse the internet, there would necessarily be a mobile-friendly webpage. Once logged in, the user would be presented with their profile. There, they would be able to view their ‘favourited’ names and enter the generation section of the website. Firstly, the generation page would have the namebases to choose from. The namebases provide the material that the generator would use to provide the names (it is functionless without them). There would be an extensive (or, if on free trial, limited) collection of namebases to select from automatically, and a way for users to edit them or upload their own. Users would be able to select multiple namebases to add more variety to their generations. The namebases would be sorted into ‘fantastical’ and ‘real-world’ categories, but these would just be suggestions. The real-world namebases would have a setting where users would be able to cross-reference them with popular baby names of certain years. Once the user selected their namebase(s), then they could begin generating names. They would select how many names they wanted, which would be set at around 10 by default. Then, instantaneously, the generated names would appear, having been generated by Markov chain and randomization, based on the selected namebases. There would also be a ‘randomization value’, which would determine how far the generator would be allowed to stray from the namebase. For example, if the randomization value was low, the names would appear very similar to the namebase. On the other hand, if it was set high, the names would appear to be chaotic mashes of components from the namebases. The correct setting would be left up to the user, but it would likely be somewhere around the higher middle. Once the user generates their names, they can select the best names for their purpose. Eventually, if they selected enough names, the generator would get an idea of the names that they liked and start recommending new names based on that. This could be controlled through a new value which would represent how adventurous the generator would be based on your preferences. Again, the ideal setting for this one would be somewhere around the high middle, but as users drew closer to a name, they could tone it down to represent finer changes. Once the user generates an acceptable name, they could download it (and the settings that produced it) to their device or save it on their profile. The webapp would also give the option for users to share their names and name generation settings with other users. There would be a rudimentary social aspect to the webapp as well – users would be able to follow others and comment on their shared settings and names. 
<br> <br>
To develop this webapp, I would need to use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I would also need to find a way to host the website, likely through a service such as Cloudflare. Security would also be an important factor, as users would be paying for the full version of the webapp. I would expect to use a reliable third-party online payments system, like PayPal, to handle the transactions associated with the program.  I would also need to properly research Markov Chains, so that I could utilise them properly in the webapp. As they are the key part of the service, special care would need to be taken.
<br> <br>

Obviously, as I am just starting to learn IT, and toiling away at creating my first website, a webapp with accounts, proper programming, subscription services, and all manner of other things, is far beyond my level at present. However, I believe with a few months of work I could have a solid foundation which would allow me to do most of the work myself. I have a few friends who would be interested in this project should I choose to pursue it, and I think they could offer the remaining tools and skills required. Overall, with a lot of persistence, I think it could be done. 
<br> <br>

If the webapp is successful, it will solve the problem by providing a comprehensive and easy to use name generation service for people who need it. New parents, writers, and role-playing-game players will never be at a loss for names ever again. It will hopefully ‘disrupt’ the current baby name website industry online, and force them to step up their game. In the future, the webapp will continue to update and provide more useful features, perhaps even neural network based name generation. Perhaps it may also make the tradition to mobile phone app, providing even more convenience for all sorts of people who need a quick and customizable variety of names.
