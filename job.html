    <h1>My Ideal Job</h1>

The job I have found is a support job for the global tech company Google. Specifically, it is for a IT Support Engineer. 
<br><br>
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/googlry">I have saved a copy of the job listing here. </a>
<br><br>
The position involves doing tech support with the many services Google offers. It appeals to me because I have heard Google is a great employer, and it would be fun to work in Sydney. I also like helping people.
<br><br>
To apply for the position, I would need at least a bachelor’s degree in IT, experience at a help desk, and support experience. I don’t have much of these, but as a long-suffering retail employee, I have a lot of experience providing help to grumpy customers.  I would obtain these skills by continuing to study IT and starting in a more entry-level IT position in the meantime.
